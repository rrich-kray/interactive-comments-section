## Description

Another frontend mentor challenge which I undertook to gain experience implementing a React global context for authentication within a REST API (as apposed to GraphQL). In the end, the implementation was very similar to that within a GraphQL API - The only difference was that the POST route generated a token and returned it to the frontend as opposed to a GraphQL mutation. With that said, the rest of the application is bare bones - users can login/register, and add comments.
